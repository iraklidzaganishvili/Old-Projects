        I woke up late in the evening as always, but today unlike the most other days I couldn’t sleep. A fear was holding me a hostage. Not a fear of death, or a fear of losing my relatives but a fear of unasked doom…<br>
        I went to the kitchen to eat pretending that nothing was happening. My wife didn’t know yet that the wall started to collapse under the pressure of the creatures of the night and despite all of our efforts to prevent it there was nothing we could do now. My hands were shaking and my face was dark and gloomy. My wife instantly sensed that something was wrong and asked what was happening. I couldn’t tell her. I wanted everyone to live the last months of their life without the pressure of the future. She kept asking and asking and I couldn’t think of any excuse to go to work and escape the conversation. I told her that things weren’t working out at work and that I didn’t want to talk about it. She left me alone. I finished my dinner and went to work. People here where the only ones to know what was going on. My job for the last several years was to make sure that the wall was standing and to improve it so our dome was secure. For all of those years we were able to sustain the wall, but just last night we saw a huge crack in it. We sent a professional to see the outer part of the wall and he returned with some bad news.<br> 
        He said that the wall was as weak as ever and that it was starting to crumble. He showed us the pictures he took of the outside part of it. By our estimates the wall would fall in several months, but the first signs of the creatures of the night would only show up in about a month. Our job now was to postpone the inevitable. The only hope was that there was something outside of the fog, so we could move there and never fear the night again. <br>
        A week later one of the youngest explorers of the farthest parts of the fog returned with some great news. He found a huge bright area illuminated by what he described as: a blob light coming down from the sky. He saw the sun! For so long no one has seen the sun. No one has seen the sun for generations. That was the hope we had, the hope that we could do something to prevent our early demise and that our children could live without the constant fear of darkness.<br>
        When I returned home for the first time in more than a week I was able to sleep properly and I went to work incredibly refreshed the next day. Our time of the work has changed because our work wasn’t to study the night creatures any more. Now it was to ensure that we had time to move to a safe place. We sent out a brave individual to stay out of the wall for the night. We sent him to the new sunny place that we discovered which we called “Greenar”. He returned unhurt the next day. The place was safe to move into. Now we just needed to move in time. The news where finally announced and we started packing. There where 5000 people behind the wall, so we wouldn’t be able to move all of them in one day. Also we would need to set up basic infrastructure. So we started out by finding a good watercourse. Then we built some camps. We ensured that we could get enough food and we were ready to start moving people. A month has passed since we saw the crack in the wall. That night before I went to sleep I heard a weird sound. I heard someone calling my name. Even though I did not respond, I could still hear the sound. It seemed like it was coming from nowhere. These were the first signs we predicted. The next night someone started calling my name again and when I responded the voice said: “hello there”.<br>
        <br>
        -  Who are you?  I asked
        <br>
        -  Well that’s pretty rude, you should have first said “Hi”.
        <br>
        - I fear that you are a night creature and that you want to kill me, so I am sorry if I am rude.
        <br>
        -“Night creatures” that’s what you call us. That’s a very scary name, I understand now why you are so scared of me.
        <br>
        -Well, we call you that because you only come at night and want to kill us all.
        <br>
        -Do you really think life is that simple? We are the bad guys who want to kill the good guys just because?
        <br>
        -Well, you do want to kill us.
        <br>
        -Have any one of you ever died because of us?
        <br>
        -Well, the wall has been protecting us from you for three generations and you weren’t able to reach us.
        <br>
        -And what happened before the wall? Before we were trying to “kill you”?
        <br>
        -I simply don’t know.
        <br>
        -Well, I won’t break your ignorant child beliefs.
        <br>
        He stopped speaking to me. I didn’t yet understand what he meant by “ignorant child beliefs”, but that really bothered me. He was invisible that night because they were still not strong enough to be visible. It’s believed that nobody knows how a night creature looks, because when you see it you instantly die. I couldn’t sleep. The next day I told everything to my wife and she told me that I shouldn’t worry about it and that it was probably just a way to confuse me and distract me from our main goal.<br>
        The first thousand people moved to Greenar and settled there for the night. The next morning they sent a messenger to inform us that everything was ok and that they were ready to take on another thousand. We didn’t have time to send another thousand because if the creatures could talk to us they could kill us in several days. So we sent two thousand people, because if we sent more, the camp wouldn’t be able to handle that many people at once. It was the last night for us staying behind the walls and we hoped that everything would go fine. In the middle of the night, we heard a scream from one of the houses. Sweat started dripping from my hands. Was that it? Did the night creatures gain enough strength to start killing us? We rushed into the house and saw a woman crying in fear. It turned out she was crying from the sounds talking to her. She couldn’t see anyone yet she was talking to everyone…<br>
        The night didn’t bring any fatalities and we got the messenger from Greenar saying that we could move in. We packed our stuff, met with our relatives and started the full day journey to Greenar. We arrived late in the evening exhausted, but happy to see the sun. I have never seen the sun until that moment, but my grandma told me that it was incredibly beautiful. I now understood what she was talking about.  The sunset was amazing: the red sun going down and disappearing. Me and my wife were sitting on a hill watching it. We forgot about all of our problems, all of the fears we ever had. For a brief moment we even forgot about the creatures of the night, because there was no need to fear them in the new paradise, called Greenar. Oh how wrong we were!!!<br>
        When the sun completely was out of sight, we saw thousands of shadows coming from the direction of the fog. These where the night creatures in their true beauty. How have they escaped the fog? Why have not they killed other people before us? My wife hugged me. She understood that those were our last moments together. As the shadows passed, my wife fell into my hands without a sound.  I heard the voice again:<br>
        <br>
        - So, we meet again my old friend.
        <br>
        -Are you the night creature that I spoke to several days ago? I said crying.
        <br>
        - Yes and I see that you are in deep pain right now. You lost your loved ones. I am sorry for all the brutality, but it had to be done.
        <br>
        - You killed my wife! I Screamed in rage.
        <br>
        - You will soon understand everything my friend.
        <br>
        - Why don’t you just kill me?! I lost everything and everyone because of you.
        <br>
        - You will stay alive for now.
        <br>
        Suddenly my wife’s motionless body disappeared and I stopped feeling anything…
        <br>
        - What’s happening?  I asked without any emotions.
        <br>
        - It is fine, you will be more rational this way.
        <br>
        - I have so many questions: who are you? What happened three generations ago? Are there any humans left except me?
        <br>
        - Don’t worry, I will explain everything.
        <br>
        And so he began telling his story, while my friends and family were massacred.<br>
        A long time ago, humans loved a thing called war. Leaders of nations would command their soldiers to fight to death for the gain of those leaders, while they were sitting in their offices. The worst thing was that people were choosing those leaders and supporting their actions. One day, when there was a war between two of the most powerful nations, one of them invented a weapon unlike any other, a weapon that could be used by that nation to rule over all the others: us! A fog that would be cast on a nation destroying its main city and spreading outwards from the fog to destroy the whole country. The problem with this weapon was that we had something that wasn’t understood well by scientists at the time: “consciousness”. Scientists accidently created a race of powerful super-creatures. We were peaceful with everyone and wanted to create peace among all of the nations in a non-violent way (by diplomacy and peaceful teachings), but before we could do anything the nation unleashed the entirety of its arsenal on us: first they made it so, that we were only able to move at night. Then they used everything they could to erase us from the planet. Other nations were unsupportive of this idea and the politicians that were interested in that were swiftly thrown away by the overwhelming mob of our supporters. After a brief battle with the nation that created us, we won and swore that everyone that waged war and suffering on others would be destroyed. The survivors of our parent nation hid behind the built walls, that were impenetrable by us. Many years later we destroyed every wall except for yours. It would have taken us years, even decades to blast through you wall, but after you saw the crack and found a spot that wasn’t in the fog you sent a person to stay there at night. We didn’t touch him or anyone else before every one of you moved out. We wanted to finally end the war that you started and that we disapproved off. We broke our morals by wiping you out, but I think we did a good thing by that. We destroyed a dictator and achieved peace among all other nations.<br>
        They left me alive for me to write this book of the past events from my point of view and as a thank you they left me alive, but without any feelings left, a life of meaningless existence. I could see the sun, talk to other people but I can’t feel anything. Maybe that’s a good thing, as I won’t feel the pain of my loss and will be able to tell my story to people I meet. <br>

        I used to have it all… riches, friends, people who thought of me as a god… then I tried to pursue a goal that was impossible to achieve: freedom, freedom among all and everyone.<br> 
        So, I lay here in a freezing prison cell waiting to be executed.  Backstabbed by the very own people I tried to free… tomorrow they will watch and tell their kids: “look, look, this man, the betrayer of our people and our wonderful government is finally brought to justice!”<br> 
        Will they be right? did I betray you? Or are you just ignorant to all of the horrors your subjects, people who you have known from your childhood have to go through every single day just because you don’t care about none but yourself? Don’t you see the pain and suffering that your people go through just so that you can sleep in a comfortable bed? And the people above looking at everyone from their white palace seeing only the fraction of people they swore to protect. Why don’t they care that the castle they live in was built by their enslaved citizens, who had to work day and night just so they could sleep in a more comfortable bed than anyone else? Why am I the only one who sees, who cares, who wants to help? I could have lived the rest of my life with my eyes closed pretending to be blind, pretending that I didn’t see, didn’t care… but no! I went on to help the millions of poor, selfless working, individuals. But all I saw was treason, betrayal and more suffering. None wanted to be helped, none wanted to be saved from the lives that they have been doomed to. The only thing they cared about was self-gain. They were ready to sell their parents to the highest bidder if they got the chance to do so.  The only thing they cared about was getting rich and so escaping their old lives. They didn’t want freedom, all they wanted was for their friends to look at them and say: “one day I want to achieve that kind of power”. All they wanted was to look down on their families and peers, to laugh at their pain... I don’t blame any of them though. As children that’s just what they have been taught, if they didn’t follow the crowd, if they weren’t a part of it, they would be thrown out of the communities to rot in prisons. I tried to help these people and set them free. But the blindness, the endless persistence of a goal, that so little could achieve, made them not care about the freedom. Unlike me they can achieve their goals and some of them will, but they can never achieve something they don’t seek.  Maybe I am a fool, who tried to do the impossible, who wanted to fly to the stars with a firework. I hope that’s not the case though. I hope that at least some people’s lives will be improved by my death. I hope that the world will become a little bit better, and that the people will learn that wealth and status shouldn’t be the only goal in society, but that there is a way to live in peace and harmony. I had everything that they wanted to achieve. But I hoped that everyone would have much, much more…<br>
